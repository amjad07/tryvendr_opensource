# tryvendr_opensource
 This try vendr project design is now opensource on behalf of the developers because the tryvendr didn't release the payment of milestones
 
 The design and wireframes  of the tryvendr, we are open source to all users. We were the developers of the tryvendr community but they unfortunately ditch us and didn't release the milestones payment.
I would like to tell the investors of tryvendr that they have worst management and steal the code without releasing milestones payments.

I trusted them but they ditch us. We are also attaching the screenshots of our conversation. 

Here are the code files you can download https://github.com/amjad07/tryvendr_opensource.git 

Screenshots of communication with Alex (probably the financial manager of the company) is attached \n
